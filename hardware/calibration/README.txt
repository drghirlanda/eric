calibration.c 

This calbiration utility enables one to center the ERIC servomotor
precisely. It is run through the run.sh shell script. 

Pin numbers are set in run.sh - make sure they match those in
eric/software/arc/effectors.arc.

Once you have determined the values giving the correct calibration,
write them in the servomotor section of effectors.arc.
