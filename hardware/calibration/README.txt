This calbiration utility enables one to center the ERIC servomotor 
precisely. The pins are hardcoded - make sure they match those in 
eric/software/arc/effectors.arc.

The values giving the correct calibration (minimum and maximum 
positions) should be set in the same file (servomotor lines).

It is run throuhg the run.sh shell script.
